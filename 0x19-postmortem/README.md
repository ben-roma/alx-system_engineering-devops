# Postmortem: The Day the Data Went Silent - A Data Import Saga

## Issue Summary
On the morning of August 10th, 2024, from 09:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC+1), our data import process led to a significant disruption in our phone system. This incident impacted approximately 30% of our client data records, causing errors in customer information displays and preventing users from accessing certain services. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration following a system update that altered the way data fields were processed.

## Timeline
- **00:00 AM (midnight)**: The data import system update was deployed successfully.
- **07:30 AM**: IT team members arrived at the office to begin the day's work.
- **09:00 AM**: First reports of customer data inconsistencies were received.
- **09:10 AM**: The support team confirmed the issue after checking several accounts.
- **09:20 AM**: The Data Management team began investigating import logs for errors.
- **09:45 AM**: Initial hypothesis suggested a data formatting issue, but no anomalies were found.
- **10:00 AM**: The incident was escalated to the software engineering team.
- **10:30 AM**: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration introduced by the update, which changed how data fields were interpreted.
- **11:00 AM**: The team manually corrected the affected data and reconfigured the import tool.
- **11:30 AM**: The issue was fully resolved, and services were restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**: The system update introduced a new field configuration in the data import process that was not set correctly, leading to misinterpretation and corruption of customer data.

**Resolution**: The configuration was corrected, and the affected data was restored from backups. A macro was developed to automate the data reformatting process for future imports, preventing similar issues.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Validation Process**: Implement an automatic validation step after data imports to catch similar issues early.
- **Testing Protocol**: Establish a more rigorous testing protocol for all software updates before they are deployed in production environments.
- **Automation**: A macro was created to automate the data reformatting needed for client statements, significantly reducing the risk of manual errors.
- **Training and Documentation**: Ensure that all team members are trained on new system features introduced by updates and that all configuration steps are documented.

## Conclusion
_"When the phones went silent, we thought our office had suddenly been teleported to a monastery. Turns out, it was just a small oversight in our system update. After a bit of digging (and a lot of coffee), we found the missing piece and got our data back on track."_

_"Remember, in tech (and in life), it's not about avoiding mistakesâ€”it's about learning from them. Next time, we'll be double-checking those configurations, and you should too!"_
